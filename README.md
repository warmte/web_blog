## [warmte.me](http://warmte.me "warmte.me")

Personal website [warmte.me](http://warmte.me "warmte.me") with a lot of information about me and the blog-section with a number of texts written by me. I decided to make it when I faced with necesserity to put some long text from my telegram blog somewhere to keep them structured, readable and available all the time. So I did it :)

- I designed all parts of the Web Application and made detailed work plan to avoid any inconsistencies.

- I implemented the frontend part using Vue.js framework with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

- I implemented the backend part using Apache Maven and Spring framework with Java.

- Then I established interaction between frontend, backend and MySQL database.

- And then I released it in production.

Enjoy!
